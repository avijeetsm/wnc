How often is it okay to congradulate just the efforts.
Well at least when the conditions are non favourable to say the least. Yes, we all did it again. And this time we did it at BTR.

Through citizen partnership and as a token of love and affection we distributed 150 bagpacks to be used at the choukis.

Early Highlights (as data is yet being collected and analysed) are:
