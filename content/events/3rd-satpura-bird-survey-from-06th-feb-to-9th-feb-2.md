3rd Satpura Bird Survey was organised by Satpura Tiger Reserve in collaboration with WNC, Indore from 6th to 9th february 2020.

Around 90 birders got an opportunity to identify and report birds in prestine beauty and wilderness. We are expecting more than 250 species of birds to be reported this time, among which some species are a totally new reporting.

The rare sightings were - black eagle, bar winged flycatcher shrike, spotted treecreeper, brown cheeked fulvetta, tickell's leaf warbler.

Due to heavy rains and availability of water in almost whole of central india the winter migratory birds are late and less in both numbers and diversity. Still the observed species were - bar headed goose, ruddy shelduck, ultramarine flycatcher, common teal, red crested pochard.

Each participant was supplied with medical kit, trail kit and blankets. As a gesture of good faith the participants donated the blankets at their respective base camps to be used by the grassroot level forest workers.

We are very gratefull to the field director Shri SK Singh, Mr RS Bhadoria (assistant director STR) and all the forest department for their support and guidance to make this a fruitfull event.
