We are going to plant 1000 saplings. In first Phase we started with plantation of 225 sapplings.

Plant selection and quality of soil was done under the supervision of our member Mr BS Saraswat (horticulture expert) and Mr Dinesh Gawali.

Amaltas, Gulmohar, Jamun, Lasoda, Bohiniya, Karanj, Baheda and Kusum etc were the different varities of saplings that were selected for afforestation.

With time this afforested area will provide clean and breathable air for generations to come.

Also it will help rehabitate the flora and fauna of nearby area and migrants as well.
