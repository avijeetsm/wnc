On 15th Feb, WNC team welcomed amazing children from SPS Sanstha to Umrikheda Eco Tourism Park for a day filled with wildlife wonders! The magic began when we saw many familiar faces and they still remembered the birds and plants we taught them! 🌳✨

Their excited voices calling out tree names and bird species showed us how lasting our impact truly is. During our nature trail, the children shared local stories and myths — we listened respectfully, corrected misconceptions, and gave them right information. This two-way exchange helped reinforce learning and build trust. 🐦

The real joy came during our interactive games where children stalked for birds, trees, and flowers on their templates, participating with pure enthusiasm. This time, we added something crucial — snake awareness! We taught them the difference between venomous and non-venomous snakes, why killing them is wrong, and what to do during the encounters. 🐍

Between delicious dal Pania and laddoos, laughter during park games, and those "aha!" moments during learning, we witnessed how nature education shapes young minds toward conservation. These children aren't just learning about wildlife — they're becoming its future protectors!

Building tomorrow's conservationists, one curious mind at a time. 💚
