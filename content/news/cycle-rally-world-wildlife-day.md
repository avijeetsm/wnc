On 3rd March WNC observed the World Wildlife Day by organizing a cycle rally for awareness.
The cycle rally had one motive , to create awareness among citizens of Indore towards wildlife ,its importance and also to try to connect them to the nature.
Nearly 80 wildlifers and cyclists gathered at Palasia early morning and cycled their way till Rajwada where they paid tribute to Devi Ahilyabai Holkar. On the way to rajwada the cyclists passed through the Indore Municipal Zoo. They enjoyed the conservation efforts and the variety of birds and animals. An awareness lecture was also organized in front of the cage of the national animal the Royal Bengal Tiger.
The highlight of the rally was the enthusiasm of kids who cycled nearly 12 kms to spread awareness.
After paying off our respect ,we went on to enjoy our indori spirit with " Pooha and jalebi".
