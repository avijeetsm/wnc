We just completed the annual Badgonda Butterfly Survey with MP forest department at the largest nursery in MP. A beautiful landscape well maintained my MP Forest department.
We also distributed T-shirts and caps to the front line staff at the nursery for doing the good work.

The data is not yet finalized and scrutinized but broadly 39 species were identified. We will share the detailed report soon.
The staff also organized a delicious lunch made of typical malwi cuisine- "Dal Bafle, Laddu, Aloo sabji, Kadhi, and Chutney". Yum yummy and full tummy...
Thanks for all the support and we will keep working stronger to help conserve some more.

Also thanks to all the volunteers who joined us today in this endeavor to make it a successful event.
