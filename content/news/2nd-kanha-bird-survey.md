2nd Kanha Bird Survey was organised by Kanha Tiger Reserve in collaboration with WNC, Indore from 18th to 21st February 2021.

Around 85 birders from 11 different states got an opportunity to identify and report birds in prestine beauty and wilderness. We are expecting more than 250 species of birds to be reported this time,among which some species are a totally new reporting.

The rare sightings were -Himalayan Ruby throat,Fire capped tit, Bar winged flycatcher shrike,Brown cheeked fulvetta, Himalayan vulture, Griffon vulture ,Velvet fronted nuthatch,White rump shama, Scarlet Minivet, White throated fantail etc.

Each participant was supplied with medical kit, and trail kit. As a gesture of good faith the participants donated 100 blankets at Kanha Tiger Reserve to be used by the grass-root level forest workers.

We are very grateful to the field director Shri SK Singh,Mr Naresh Yadav (DD buffer), Mr. Sudhir Mishra (AD KTR), Mr. Sunil Sinha (AD buffer) and all the forest department for their support and guidance to make this a fruitfull eventt.
