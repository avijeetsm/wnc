Team WNC once again successfully conducted plantation at Baroda- Daulat on 18th July 2021. Following the covid norms, limited no. of members were invited for plantation.
Tree guards were put to ensure that plants do not get destroyed by grazing animals and other threats.
Local villagers and children passionately took part in this event and it was amazing to see their commitment to safeguarding this sapling & has taken the responsibility to nurture and help it grow.
Trees like banyan, Peepal, Jamun, Neem were planted with heights of above 12 ft.
So finally we are sure that with the support of villagers our saplings will grow into beautiful trees that will benefit our future generation...
