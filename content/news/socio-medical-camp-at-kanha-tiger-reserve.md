Greetings from our recent small endeavour at Kanha Tiger Reserve

We at WNC have always supported conservation of nature and wildlife with a multi pronged approach. One of our constant efforts is to ensure that the life of our frontline forest staff is improved in some way. One such activity was the "Socio-Medical Camps" that we conducted at KTR on 13 April 2024 with the support of the forest department.
We cannot thank the team at Kanha Tiger Reserve (KTR) enough, starting with FD Shri S.K.Singh sir for supporting and guiding us during such activities and efforts wholeheartedly.
We along with a team of doctors, healthcare workers, and scientists examined nearly 361 forest staff for non-communicable diseases like diabetes, hypertension and oral cancer in addition to general check-up. Raja Ramanna Center for Advanced Technology (RRCAT), Indore has always supported us with the use of their oncodiagnoscope which is an indigenous technology for cancer screening.
We also provided the staff with the prescribed medicines, sweatshirts, stationary for their kids, and oral health care package as care just doesn't just start and stop with health check-ups.

Thanks to all those who supported us in planning and executing this activity. Special thanks to Shri Nitish Agarwal and Shri Ankit Agarwal for their generosity and support.
