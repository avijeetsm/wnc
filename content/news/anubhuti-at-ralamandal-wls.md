"Anubhuti" literally means to feel, and nature is perhaps the purest medium through which we truly learn to feel connected, grounded, and alive. Yesterday, we had the opportunity to be part of the Anubhuti Camp at Ralamandal, where our WNC was invited to engage with children from a government school in a nearby village. It was a meaningful chance to offer them what many of us received much later — an understanding of nature through experience.

One of the most impactful moments was the simple yet powerful explanation of the ecosystem versus the 'ego system' — how nature thrives on coexistence and balance, while an ego-driven approach leads to imbalance and harm. Through engaging discussions, Dr. Pallavi Vaze introduced wildlife, habitat needs, responsible forest behaviour, and the ill effects of littering and feeding animals. Coordinated seamlessly by MP Forest Department officials, the session was interactive, insightful, and deeply enriching.
