We are so happy and blessed to even report this back to all the birding enthusiasts. We just completed the 2nd Winter Bird Survey at the Panna Tiger Reserve (PTR) between 5-8 December 2024.

The reserve which showcased how dedication can bring back to life an entire ecosystem and became a case study on wildlife conservation has rejuvinated its efforts towards avi-fauna conservation.

A massive task considering the conditions at PTR but the forest department under the leadership of FD PTR Mrs Anjana Firkey mam was ready and well prepared. During the survey nearly 100 participants covered the whole reserve area in nearly 40+ teams and came up with an initial estimate of 270+ species.

Some notable highlights being:

<ul>
  <li>Forest Wagtail</li>
  <li>Ashy Minivet</li>
  <li>Black Eagle</li>
  <li>Cinerous Vulture</li>
  <li>Dusky Eagle Owl</li>
  <li>Eastern Orphean Warbler</li>
  <li>Rufous Tailed Scrub Robin</li>
  <li>Fire Capped Tit</li>
  <li>Marshall's Iora</li>
</ul>

The participants also donated 100 blankets for the welfare of frontline forest staff as a part of their application fees.

A lot was learned, a lot was explored, a lot still remains which will happpen over time as WNC, Indore will keep on collaborating with PTR.
