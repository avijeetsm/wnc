We are very happy to release the report of the first Butterfly Survey from Sanjay Dubri Tiger Reserve. It was a magical experience to scientifically chart the distribution of the winged wonders.
Special thanks to the forest department at SDTR and grateful to the guidance and support we continue to receive from Shri Amit Dubey, FD SDTR.
He released this report during the inaugural of the second bird survey, and this showcases the liberal efforts on the part of the forest department towards wildlife conservation and engagement of citizen scientists.
Enjoy the members of *order Lepidoptera*
Regards
WNC Indore
