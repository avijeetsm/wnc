The book was released on the occasion of wildlife week at Bhopal on 7 October 2024.

This photobook was inspired by Field Director Kanha Tiger Reserve Shri S K Singh.He is the soul and the strength behind this book and without his guidance, motivation and inspiration this photobook would have never come to fruition.

This book is dedicated to all chokidars, sharmik, drivers,mahawat and all the grassroot level staff at the KTR. These men and women protect the pristine beauty of Kanha without any recognition.

We are also thankful to all the volunteers for participating in the survey from across India.These participants gave their best to make this documentation successful and we have also covered all of them in this book.

Photos credits have also been given to those who contributed in this books with their beautiful and stunning photographs.
