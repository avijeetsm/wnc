WNC organised a wildlife photography exhibition in Indore on 29 & 30 July 2023. Shri Shankar Lalwani Ji, Honourable member of Parliament from Indore, joined the event during the inauguration and graced us with his presence and support.
The exhibition showcased stories from the wild in the form of images. These stories by WNC members were from across the country. These images covered various species displaying the immense diversity we possess in our country. Indorians, many of whom were new to the field of wildlife conservation, of all ages interacted & learned about the need to conserve the nature. Along with this they were introduced to the value addition done by our welfare and conservation activities.
This exhibition was a visual means to spread awareness and recreate a sense of connection with the nature.
We thank all our supporters who help us protect and conserve our bio-heritage.
