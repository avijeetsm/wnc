Happy to share info about one of our plantation drives with the collaboration and support of villagers and children at Baroda Daulat.

Saplings were planted and secured with tree guards around the periphery of the beautiful lake. It was wonderful day blessed with showers instead of humidity and enthusiasm instead of bikering. Small kids were ready to plant the saplings with commitment to further take care of them.

As a part of our behavior change activity we made them "vraksh mitra" and will write the names of the individual on the tree guards to inculcate the behavior of ownership and love for the trees among the villagers, the kids being our models and ambassadors. We also rewarded their hard work with little token of love. Gifted them cap and stationary to motivate them further.

Goes without saying, very thankful to all the members of WNC who took part in the event and hope the rest be part of the upcoming events too.
