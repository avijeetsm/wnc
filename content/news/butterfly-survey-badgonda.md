After a long wait
With ambiance at its best
Shining sun gave us the chance
To spot the butterfly's in their mating dance
Nature's basket was indeed full of spectacles
Winged wonders flying and keeping high their tentacles
Heat and humidity gave us a nice tan
But then there were some butterfly's of which we were a fan
The survey was conducted, the teams were three
Badgonda nursery was the location, the entry was free
The food was delicious after an exhaustive track
Dal pania was the menu with yummy ghee filled cracks
Bharta and chutney, along with rabdi was added to the lunch pack
By the afternoon we were back in our shacks
Approx. 44 species of butterflies were identified.
Highlights of the survey-
1.Angled Castor
2.Dark Palm dart
3.white orange tip
4.Psyche
At last would like to appreciate the enthusiasm and hard work of all the participants and valuable support from the forest dept.
