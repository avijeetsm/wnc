We are pleased to share that, 1st Summer Bird Survey has successfully been conducted at Pench Tiger Reserve in collaboration with WNC from 12th -15th May 2022.

54 volunteers from across India participated in this survey. The aim was to identify, map & report the different species of birds and their frequency of sighting during the summer season at Pench. The rationale of this program is to document and make the data more robust by collecting the species of birds found in all different weather conditions.

During the inaugural session 1st Pench Bird Winter Bird Survey Report was also released by the Field director Sh Ashok Kumar Mishra Sir. In the winter survey 251 species of birds were recorded at Pench Tiger Reserve.

Highlights of the Summer survey so far have been:

<ul>
<li>Amur falcon</li>
<li>Banded Bay cuckoo</li>
<li>Indian Pitta</li>
<li>Indian Scimitar babbler</li>
<li>Red avadavat</li>
<li>Common hawk cuckoo</li>
<li>Indian cuckoo</li>
<li>Fork tailed drongo cuckoo</li>
<li>Brown fish owl</li>
</ul>

For the survey each participant was provided with a trail kit. This kit was packed keeping in mind the scorching heat and weather conditions at Pench. We must say that every Participant was filled with courage, enthusiasm and the love for the nature and that nothing could stop them from birding even in such harsh conditions. As a gesture of good faith the participants donated torch at Pench tiger reserve. These will be distributed to the grass-root level forest workers.
