<ul>
<li>Oral health checkup and oral cancer screening</li>
<li>General health check up</li>
<li>Blood sugar and Blood pressure monitor</li>
<li>Dispensation of prescribed medicines</li>
<li>Stationary for school going kids</li>
<li>Warm clothes for upcoming winter</li>

</ul>

This is our effort to add love and care to the grass root forest department staff. A token of love to our very own who protect and maintain such gorgeous landscapes and their biodiversity.

As many of you have earlier showed the interest to contribute for the same, hence we decided to put it out this time. We are looking for your generous support, and help for this noble cause.
