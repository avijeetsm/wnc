How often is it okay to congradulate just the efforts.
Well at least when the conditions are non favourable to say the least. Yes, we all did it again. And this time we did it at BTR.
Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve (BTR) along with WNC (Wildlife and Nature Conservancy), Indore and citizen volunteers successfully completed 1st Summer Bird Survey at BTR from 23rd to 26th May 2024.

FD BTR Shri L.L Uikey , DD Shri Prakash Verma inaugurated the bird survey where as PCCF Shri UK Subuddhi along with DD Shri Prakash Verma precided over the concluding session along with certificate distribution.

Through citizen partnership and as a token of love and affection we distributed 150 bagpacks to be used at the choukis.

Early Highlights (as data is yet being collected and analysed) are:
Emerald Dove,
Cinnamon Bittern,
Black- bellied Tern,
Banded Bay Cuckoo,
Oriental Scops Owl,
Fork- tailed Drongo Cuckoo,
Tri-coloured Munia.

Wildlife & Nature Conservancy, Indore (WNC) would like to thank the entire staff of BTR for the generous support, active participation and ownership.
The weather during the summer equinox was at its peak to welcome the volunteers who did exceptional hard-work in their efforts to make this Bird Survey a success.
